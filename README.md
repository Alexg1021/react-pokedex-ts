# Team Alkali React Challenge Project

This project represents a challenge to test your git flow, programming, and troubleshooting fundamentals. Below you will find instructions on how to complete the challenge, as well as additional information on how to stand up and navigate this project.

## Challenge Instructions

You will begin by creating a fork of this repository to your own Github account. All work will be completed and reviewed within your own fork. Please do not create a Pull Request (PR) back into this repository.

Once you have created your fork, review the Issues labeled `challenge task` [HERE](https://github.com/Alexg1021/react-pokedex-ts/issues). Bitwise Consulting standard for branching is as follows:

- Maintain a `master` and development (`development`) branch on your fork
- For each feature/task (Issue), create a new branch based off of your `development` branch
- Once a task has been completed, create a Pull Request from the working branch to your `development` branch and reference the Issue you are working on. **These open PRs will be the final submission which I will review.**

Once you are ready to submit your work, send an message to your apprentice lead with a link to your fork.

**Please apply the following Shift3 Standard Practices as you work on this project:**

- Each unit of work (Issue) should be completed within its own [branch](https://github.com/Shift3/standards-and-practices/blob/master/standards/branching.md).
- Use Karma-style formatting for your [Git Commit Messages](https://github.com/Shift3/standards-and-practices/blob/master/standards/commits.md).
- Generate a PR for each unit of work (Issue) which is completed. Keep the scope of these PRs as narrow as possible. Try not to create PRs which rely on or contain code from previous PRs unless there is truly a dependency between the two units of work.

## Running the project

- After cloning the repo, go into the project's root directory and run `npm install`
- After installing dependencies run `npm start` to commence your project.
